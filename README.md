### Hi, there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m dreaming of becoming a Data Scientist, specializing in Recommender Systems. While pursuing undergraduate degree in Economics, I became attracted to consumersâ€™ preferences and choices. So, during master's course, I conducted a study on recommender systems, curating items that match consumer preferences under information uncertainty about their tastes. Now, I am broadening my research by applying recommender system techniques to solve matching problem in diverse domains, such as click-through rate prediction, Information Retrieval, and beyond.
